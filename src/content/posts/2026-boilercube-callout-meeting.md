Our callout meeting is a chance to learn what we’re building, how the team is structured, and how you can get involved this semester.

Callout meeting: Tuesday, January 20
Application due: Friday, January 24 (short — just so we can get to know you)

See the flyer above for full details. We hope to see you there!
