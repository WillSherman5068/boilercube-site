BoilerCube competed in the **2025 AIChE Chem-E Cube Competition** in Boston, where student teams from across the country presented compact chemical engineering systems.

We are proud to share that BoilerCube earned **3rd place overall** and received the **Entrepreneurship Award**.

Our project focused on a modular, grid-independent Direct Air Capture cube designed for affordability, safety, and deployability. Judges evaluated teams on technical design, feasibility, communication, and real-world impact.

The Entrepreneurship Award recognized our team’s focus on manufacturability, deployment pathways, and the potential for real-world adoption beyond the competition.

We would like to thank our sponsors, mentors, and supporters who made this experience possible. This achievement motivates us as we continue refining the cube and preparing for future competitions and outreach.
